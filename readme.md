## Mission model building

The robot interacts with mission models on the field
for points. The mission models are built in Sessions
1-4 in the Engineering Notebook. To build the mission
models (models), use the LEGO pieces from your
Challenge set and instructions from firstlegoleague.
org/missionmodelbuildinginstructions. It would take
one person about six hours to build all the models.
Models need to be built perfectly. “Almost perfect”
is not good enough. If you practice with incorrect
models, the robot will have problems at competitions.
Best practice is for at least two people to check each
other as they build.

## Field mat placement

- *STEP 1* – Check the table surface for bumps. Sand or
file them away and then vacuum well.

- *STEP 2* – On the vacuumed table only, unroll and
place the mat as shown below. Never fold the mat,
and never crush or bend a rolled mat.

- *STEP 3* – Slide the mat against the south and east
border walls. When table size and mat placement are
correct, the area west of the mat measures about
X = 13.5 by Y = 45 in. (343 mm by 1,143 mm).

- *STEP 4* – Optional – To hold the mat in place, you can
use thin strips of black tape, covering only the mat’s
east/west black borders

## Dual lock

Find the tan sheets of this reclosable fastening
material from 3M™ in your challenge set.
SECURING MODELS – “X” squares show where to
Dual Lock models to the mat. Use the Dual Lock as in
this example and be very exact.

__MODEL STRESS__ – When pressing a model down, press on its lowest solid base instead of crushing the whole
model. Lift that same part if you need to separate the model from the mat.

## Mission model placement

__LOOSE MODELS__ – Place loose models as described or shown here. Models outside home need to be placed
exactly within their outline marks and aligned with any directional marks.

__HOME__ – Anywhere in home, place: 3 health units, 1 yellow cube, 2 red cubes, 2 blue cubes, 8 green cubes, and
your Innovation Project (not shown here).

## Robot Game

- The team will build a robot using LEGO® elements
and technology. They program it to autonomously
complete a series of missions in a 2.5-minute Robot
Game to score points. The robot starts in the launch
area, tries missions in the order chosen by the team,
and then returns anywhere into home.

- The team can modify the robot when it is in home
before launching it again. If needed, the robot can
be brought home by hand, but the team will lose a
precision token. The team will play several matches
but only the highest score matters.
